23 years old modern technology enthusiast, with a lot of potentials that I strive to present throughout my work. </br>
During my bachelor studies I had a passion for Embedded systems and IoT, completed the studies with thesis „Use of embedded system for biometric identification based on face recognition" with which I entered the area of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.</br>
There are many sub-fields of AI that interests me, and I still have a lot to learn about them, but I am a fast learner and I do believe that I'm capable of making positive changes in this field.</br>
Looking forward for opportunities for cooperation and learning new things.</br>
</br>
In free time I seek to try out new things and extend my hobbies list.</br>
Member of Croatian AI Association and Mensa International.</br>
